# MetaExp: Interactive Explanation and Exploration of Large Knowledge Graphs

## TODO Picture

## Motivation

We present MetaExp, a system that assists the user during the
exploration of large knowledge graphs, given two sets of initial
nodes. At its core, MetaExp presents a small set of meta-paths to the
user, which are sequences of relationships among node types. Such
meta-paths do not overwhelm the user with complex structures, yet
they preserve semantically-rich relationships in a graph. MetaExp
engages the user in an interactive procedure, which involves simple
meta-paths evaluations to infer a user-specific similarity measure.

More information can be found in the [paper](resources/paper.pdf), [slides](resources/presentation.pdf) and the [poster](resources/poster.pdf).
